.SH DESCRIPTION
	_printf produces an output to stdout according to a format as described below.

.B Format of the format string
	The format string is a character string. It's composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters, other than "%", and conversion specifications. Conversion specifications fetch subsequent arguments and are introduced by the character '%'. The arguments must correspond with the conversion specifier. 

.SH Conversion Specifiers
.IP c
The argument passed for specifier "%c" is of type int. "%c" converts it to a unsigned char and prints a single character.
.IP s
The argument passed for specifier "%s" is a string in consta char *. "%s" prints the string pointed to by the char *.
.IP %
The argument passed is not converted, it will only print a percent sign "%". To use this you must write "%%" (\\%\ also works).
.IP i,d
The argument passed is an int argument, "%i" or "%d" do a signed decimal conversion of an integer.

.SH RETURN
	_printf will return the number of characters printed successfully.
